# Formula-1 score prediction using analytics and machine learning

This project explores the Formula 1 data analysis using Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC). It delves into the factors that contribute to the race experience for fans using machine learning, leveraging historical race data from 1950 to 2021 and fan score data ranging from (2008 - 2020) from racefans.net. This project also aims to predict the fan score for 2021.

The tasks involve the following:
- **Data Loading**: Setting up the ADW environment and loading Grand Prix data.
- **Basic Exploration**: Identifying potential factors influencing fan appreciation, like weather, circuit, and overtakes, through data visualization.
- **Advanced Exploration**: Uncovering hidden patterns by crafting features like "Come back score" and "RankVersusPosition".
- **Machine Learning Training & Prediction**: Using AutoML to build a model predicting fan scores and evaluating its accuracy.
